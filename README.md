# Project Introduction
Welcome to this small project for learning and experimentation! The project is developed in Java, using springBoot. Please take a look at the project background first, if you are interested, welcome to join in and have fun ~

# Project Background
As the song says, "you've got to play the hand you're dealt", and in this case your hand is to implement something to help us manage our food truck habit.
Our team loves to eat. They are also a team that loves variety, so they also like to discover new places to eat.
In fact, we have a particular affection for food trucks. One of the great things about Food Trucks in San Francisco is that the city releases a list of them as open data.
Your assignment is to make it possible for our teams to do something interesting with this food trucks data.

# Project Status
- As the first step in the Long March, I start by obtaining a certain type of facility.
- So far, the basic functionality of this feature has been completed, but still needs to be polished and optimized. 
- If you are instrested, please take a look at the UserStory document at: doc/UserStory/InProcess/UserStory01.md. It includes technical design, test case design and todo list.
- Dont forget to review the high level design diagram at: doc/HighLevelDesign.png, currently only a prototype.
- If you want to be involved, please review the HowToStart document at: doc/HowToStart.md. We could communicate later sometime.

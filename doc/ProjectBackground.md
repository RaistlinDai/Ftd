# Background
As the song says, "you've got to play the hand you're dealt", and in this case your hand is to implement something to help us manage our food truck habit.
Our team loves to eat. They are also a team that loves variety, so they also like to discover new places to eat.
In fact, we have a particular affection for food trucks. One of the great things about Food Trucks in San Francisco is that the city releases a list of them as open data.
Your assignment is to make it possible for our teams to do something interesting with this food trucks data.
